# TileBreaker
Note: This course has been altered and expanded - it's available online and is continually updated [HERE](http://www.coronite.net/training/web_development/web_development_lesson1.php)

This application is a modular website which was used to teach HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the Phoenix Public Library's Coderistas program. The course results in a TileBreaker game which students can customize.

The age range for the course is from around 10 years old and up, and the course can be easily altered to cover more or less material as needed.

Lesson folders in each root folder contain an `index.html` file which students can view in a browser.

## Implementation:
Download the source files and place the root folder on each student's computer.

## Requirements
- Google Chrome Browser
- A Text Editor (SublimeText Recommended)
